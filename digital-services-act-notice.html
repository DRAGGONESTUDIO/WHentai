                <h1>Digital Services Act Notice</h1>

                <p>The Digital Services Act (DSA) regulates the obligations of digital services that act as intermediaries in their role of connecting consumers with goods, services, and content. This includes online platforms, among others.</p>
                <p>The aim of the DSA is to contribute to the proper functioning of the internal market for intermediary services by setting out harmonised rules for a safe, predictable and trusted online environment that facilitates innovation.</p>
                <p>The DSA entered into force on November 16th 2022.</p>

                <h2>Information on average monthly active recipients as of August 7th 2025</h2>
                <p>Under Article 24 (2) of the DSA, online platforms are required to publish 'information on the average monthly active recipients of the service' in the EU over the period of the past six months.</p>
                <p>We have calculated the average monthly active recipients of our online platform in the EU based on the period February 1st 2025 to July 31st 2025, in accordance with Recital 77 of the DSA.</p>
                <p>During this period, the average number of monthly active recipients of our online platform in the EU was: 139,000.</p>
                <p>In accordance with Article 24 (2) of the DSA, we will continue to monitor the number of average monthly active recipients of our online platform in the EU and will publish updated information.</p>

                <h2>Point of contact for authorities</h2>
                <p>Under Article 11 of the DSA, online platforms are required to designate a single point of contact for direct communication with EU member state authorities, the European Commission and the European Board for Digital Services.</p>
                <p>These authorities can contact us about the application of the DSA at digitalservicesact@tubetraffic.com. Communication with us can be in English or Dutch. When sending an e-mail to this address, please be sure to include your full name and the name of the EU-based authority on whose behalf you are contacting us. We'll also need an email address to contact you, which should be associated with the relevant EU-based authority.</p>
                <p>If you are not contacting us about the DSA on behalf of any of these authorities, please refer to our "POINT OF CONTACT FOR USERS" as described below.</p>

                <h2>Point of contact for users</h2>
                <p>If you have a concern about a particular thumbnail and/or textual indication linking to a page with content or other information you encounter on our platform, you may report these to us by using our Notice and Action Policy.</p>
                <p>For general questions, please e-mail us at inquiries@tubetraffic.com.</p>

                <h2>Trusted flaggers</h2>
                <p>Under article 22 of the DSA, platforms are required to prioritize valid notifications regarding allegedly unlawful content submitted by entities designated as trusted flaggers by the Digital Services Coordinator.</p>
                <p>Have you been designated by the Digital Services Coordinator as a trusted flagger and do you want to file a valid notification? If so, you can contact us at digitalservicesact@tubetraffic.com.</p>

                <h2>Transparency reports</h2>
                <p>Under Article 15 (1) of the DSA, online platforms are required to make publicly available a report on content moderation they engage in.</p>
                <p><a href="#">Transparency Report of 2024</a></p>
                <p><a href="#">Transparency Report of 2023</a></p>
                <p>By providing this information we strive to build on our transparency measures to create a safe and positive online environment for our users.</p>

                <h2>Appeal and dispute resolution</h2>
                <p>We may impose certain restrictions if we believe the content you provide violates our Terms of Use or Acceptable Content Policy, or if we are required to do so by law. Under Article 20 of the (1) DSA you have the right to appeal within six months, if you believe that we have taken wrongful action against content provided by you.</p>
                <p>In addition, you can contact a certified out-of-court dispute settlement body for assistance, for example if you disagree with the outcome of an appeal. The European Commission maintains a website listing all available certified out-of-court dispute settlement bodies.</p>
                <p>No out-of-court dispute settlement bodies are currently certified. We will update this site as soon as more information is available.</p>
                <p>Decisions of out-of-court dispute settlement bodies are not binding on you or us.</p>
