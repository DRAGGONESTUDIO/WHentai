                <h3>What are cookies?</h3>
                <p>A cookie is a small file that is being delivered to you through the pages of this website and that is being stored on your computer. Local storage is an industry-standard technology that allows a website or application to store information locally on your computer or mobile device. The information stored in cookies is being used by us each time you visit our website. Cookies help us to analyze the traffic to and from our website and deliver our visitors a better experience during their visit.

According to the GDPR parts of this information could be interpreted as (online) identifiers and therefore may qualify as personal data, especially when these types of data are combined.

                <h3>How long are cookies stored on my system</h3>
                <p>Session cookies. "Session cookies" are stored for the duration of a browser session; when you close the browser, the cookie is deleted.</p>

                <p>Persistent cookies. "Persistent cookies" are stored for a preset amount of time and are typically not deleted when a browser session is closed.</p>

                <h2>Use of other (technical) information containing personal data and anonymization</h2>
                <p>When you visit and interact with our website, your browser or device automatically transmits certain technical information to our website, hosting provider and DNS service provider. Among other technical information, your IP address will temporarily be viewed, for less than a second. The technical information we derive from this is anonymous and only this information is stored by us. We have a legitimate interest in processing personal data before making the data anonymous for the purposes described below. Such information enables us to know for example, which browser type you use, what your browser settings are, what country you are in and what your referrer is. With this information we can optimize your user experience by showing the website in your language, optimize rankings, customize the user interface etc.</p>

                <p>However, we mainly use this information for analytical, statistical and research purposes, such as tracking referrals and incoming and outgoing traffic. We anonymize these data to the extent the data is not already anonymous. This means that the personal data originally obtained by us is made anonymous in such a way that the person concerned can no longer be identified based on this data and this process cannot be reversed. The data is therefore no longer personal data and there are no privacy risks associated with this. By means of this anonymized data we can perform statistical research and improve our website without compromising your privacy.</p>

                <h2>What happens to my personal data when I use certain features?</h2>
                <p>When you provide your personal data to use one of our website features, then we may temporarily process your personal data. For example, you may voluntarily provide us with your email address when reporting malware through our report tool or provide us with other (personal) data by sending us a(n) (email) message. We have a legitimate interest to process this personal data.</p>

                <h3>Age verification services</h3>
                <p>In order to comply with applicable laws in certain jurisdictions, we may be required to verify your age before granting access to our content. In such cases, age verification may involve the processing of personal data, strictly for the purpose of confirming that you have reached the legal age of majority.</p>

                <p>We use an independent age verification service, acting as a processor or independent controller. To perform this verification, you will be asked to provide personal information. This processing can include biometric data and a government-issued ID containing your name, photo, date of birth, and other details. We do not receive any personal data such as your name, date of birth, facial image, or ID information. These data are processed solely to confirm you meet the minimum age requirement. For more information about how your data is handled during this process, please refer to the privacy statement of the verification provider.</p>

                <p>When visiting our website, you may be asked to confirm your age through a popup or a redirect to the verification provider. Our age verification process can be implemented according to the principle of double anonymity. This means that:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>The verification service may be able to identify you (through facial recognition or ID checks) but does not know which website you are trying to access. It cannot deduce that you are visiting our website only that an age verification request has been made.</li>
                    <li>We receive only a confirmation from the verification service indicating whether your age has been validated.</li>
                </ul>

                <h3>Emails and other messages/mediums</h3>
                <p>The data processed by sending us an email is limited to your email-address, the content of the message and the standard technical information included in emails. We will process whatever personal data you included in the message. However, we will only process this data to handle your request or feedback. The period for which we retain personal data included in your email, depends on the scope of your request and our legal obligation to retain such data to comply with local laws and regulations, if any. Please do not send us copies of passports or identification documents. Also, please refrain from sending us unnecessary personal data through any of our features.</p>

                <p>To process certain emails, we use the customer service and ticketing system of Zendesk Inc. To this end, Zendesk temporarily processes the personal data included with your email, such as your email address, the standard technical information included in emails and the contents of your message. Zendesk has ensured that they have appropriate safeguards in place for the processing of personal data. We have executed a Data Processing Agreement with Zendesk regarding their services. For more information, please see the privacy statement of Zendesk for more information: https://www.zendesk.com/company/privacy-and-data-protection/.</p>

                <h3>Report tool</h3>
                <p>If there is an issue with content on our website, you can notify us by using our report tool. The information we process with such a report is stored temporarily and limited to technical data, which is anonymous data since this does not relate to an identified or identifiable natural person. However, if you voluntarily provide any personal (contact) information, this will be temporarily processed by us, depending on the extent of your request and our legal obligation to retain such data, if any. We will solely use this information to process your report.</p>

                <h3>Content moderation</h3>
                <p>We use a content moderation tool to check the thumbnails and titles on our site for illegal or inappropriate content. When using this tool, the personal data of performers—such as images, names, sexual preferences, and nationality—are temporarily processed. We process this data based on our legitimate interest of providing adult content in a safe manner. The data is directly sourced from the websites and stored only for the session in which it is reviewed. If a thumbnail is deemed illegal or inappropriate, it will be removed from the site. If you believe your data has been wrongly removed, you may contact us.</p>

                <h3>Cyberattacks</h3>
                <p>We use a third party to protect our website from spam and abuse, for example (D)DoS attack to our services. For this service to work, a website visitor's IP address, mouse movements and your behavior while navigating our website is collected. We have a legitimate interest to process this personal data. This data is sent to and processed by this third party for this purpose. By analyzing this information, this party can determine whether we are dealing with a real website visitor or a robot.</p>

                <h3>No memberships, subscriptions, accounts, profiles etc.</h3>
                <p>We do not provide memberships, subscriptions, accounts, profiles or any other means that lead to an agreement between you and us, except from your use of the website. We do not collect your personal data for such purposes. If you come across a feature on this website that requests your personal data for the purpose of creating such a membership, subscription, account, profile or any other means that lead to an agreement between you and us, please note this is not our feature and you should proceed with caution and report this to us.</p>

                <h2>Sharing your personal information with third parties</h2>
                <p>We will only share your data with third parties to the extent permitted by current legislation. We may provide your personal data to third parties when:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>We have engaged them to process certain data.</li>
                    <li>We have a legal basis to do so.</li>
                    <li>We are legally obligated to do so (e.g., if the police demand this in case of suspicion of a crime).</li>
                </ul>

                <p>The parties that process personal data on our behalf within the Netherlands, within the European Economic Area (EEA), or in specific circumstances outside of it, include:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>Hosting services, which process personal data to deliver secure and scalable storage and infrastructure solutions.</li>
                    <li>IT service providers, which process data such as IP addresses (limited processing) and system logs to protect against malicious activity and optimize content delivery.</li>
                    <li>Analytics platforms, which collect anonymized data on user interactions to improve the performance and functionality of our website.</li>
                    <li>Customer support providers, which support us in managing customer interactions across various commumication channels.</li>
                </ul>

                <h2>Transferring your personal information to other countries</h2>
                <p>Some of our suppliers are outside the European Economic Area (EEA). When sharing your personal data with these parties, we take appropriate safeguards to protect your privacy.</p>

                <p>The European Commission has adopted an adequacy decision for 15 countries. Based on an adequacy decision, personal data can be transferred securely from the EEA to companies in these countries, without the need for additional data protection safeguards.</p>

                <p>When we share data with companies in other countries without an adequacy decision (or US companies not covered by the EU-US Data Privacy Framework), we take supplementary measures in the form of so-called appropriate safeguards. This means that we take extra action to protect your personal data. We use, among other things, standard contractual clauses ("SCCs") for this purpose.</p>

                <p>When we transfer your personal data to parties outside the EEA on the basis of SCCs, you have the following rights:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>Request information about the transfer, including a copy of the SCCs.</li>
                    <li>Contact both us and the receiving party for information.</li>
                    <li>Submit complaints to the receiving party, the Dutch Data Protection Authority, a competent court in the EEA or an independent dispute resolution body.</li>
                    <li>Claim damages for violations of the SCCs.</li>
                </ul>

                <p>These rights are in addition to your general privacy rights under the GDPR. This privacy and cookie statement applies exclusively to the services of PB Web Media B.V. and not to other websites that are accessible via our website.</p>

                <h2>Security</h2>
                <p>We take your privacy seriously and, therefore, we have taken appropriate technical and organizational measures to prevent and minimize the risk of unauthorized or unlawful processing, inappropriate use, inaccuracy, accidental loss, destruction and/or damage of (personal) data stored on our network and systems, insofar as this is reasonably possible and expected of us.</p>

                <h2>Retention periods</h2>
                <p>We do not store your personal data longer than necessary to achieve the purposes stated in this privacy statement. Some data must be retained for a longer period due to statutory obligations.</p>
