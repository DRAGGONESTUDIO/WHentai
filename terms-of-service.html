                </ol>

                <h2>ARTICLE 6. REPEAT INFRINGEMENT POLICY</h2>
                <ol>
                    <li>If User frequently files manifestly unfounded notices or complaints, PB Web Media has the right to (temporarily) suspend User from filing more notices or complaints.</li>
                    <li>PB Web Media will notify User when it becomes aware of a manifestly unfounded notice or complaint filed by User. After the notification, User has two weeks to detest PB Web Media's assessment by providing proof the notice isn't manifestly unfounded. If User does not detest PB Web Media's assessment or fails, in PB Web Media's discretion, to provide convincing evidence PB Web Media's assessment is false, the notification will count as a manifestly unfounded notice.</li>
                    <li>The following criteria will be taken into account when assessing whether User frequently files a manifestly unfounded notice:
                        <ul>
                            <li>the severity of the notice;</li>
                            <li>the number of manifestly unfounded notices.</li>
                        </ul>
                    </li>
                    <li>Through a written and reasoned notice PB Web Media will notify User about a (temporarily) suspension. Depending on the number of times User has been suspended, the duration of the suspension is as follows:
                        <ul>
                            <li>suspended for 1 month;</li>
                            <li>suspended for 3 months;</li>
                            <li>suspended for 1 year.</li>
                        </ul>
                    </li>
                </ol>

                <h2>ARTICLE 7. RANKING</h2>
                <ol>
                    <li>The Content Previews that are shown on the Website, are ranked and made searchable to optimize the likelihood that User will discover content that they wish to see.</li>
                    <li>The ranking of Content Previews on the Website is based on several factors. The factors that will usually affect the ranking the most are:
                        <ul>
                            <li>a bidding system: where clients have the flexibility to determine the rates for our traffic services. Opting for a higher rate (or lower rate) can impact the ranking of the Content Previews;</li>
                            <li>quality of Content Previews: higher quality makes it more likely to receive more clicks from Users, thus making the Content Preview more popular and rank higher.</li>
                        </ul>
                    </li>
                    <li>Other factors that affect the ranking relatively less include among others:
                        <ul>
                            <li>rating: Users can influence the ranking by rating the content, such as giving certain content a negative rating or by providing feedback.</li>
                            <li>the IP address of the User: for example, the list of categories is optimized depending on the IP address from which User requests access to the Website. This IP address can belong to a block that is related to the country the User resides in, or to a block that is used by a VPN service that facilitates a more anonymous experience for the User;</li>
                            <li>the browser language: for example, the list of categories is optimized based on the language the User has set in their browser.</li>
                            <li>orientation setting: if the User can set the orientation option to certain presets such as gay, transgender, and/or straight, this influences for example the list of categories.</li>
                        </ul>
                    </li>
                    <li>It is the combination of the above and other factors that determines the ranking. Therefore, the ranking may differ per User, whereas PB Web Media makes no distinction in this regard. In addition, all Content Previews are accessible to all Users via the search feature on the Website.</li>
                </ol>

                <h2>ARTICLE 8. AVAILABILITY AND MAINTENANCE</h2>
                <ol>
                    <li>PB Web Media makes no promises regarding availability of the Services.</li>
                    <li>PB Web Media actively maintains Website. Maintenance can take place at any time, even if this may negatively impact the availability of the Services. In this case, maintenance is announced in advance whenever possible.</li>
                    <li>PB Web Media may from time to time adapt add or change functionalities of the Website. Your feedback and suggestions are welcome but ultimately PB Web Media decides which adaptations to carry out (or not).</li>
                    <li>If in PB Web Media's opinion nuisance, damage or other danger arises for the systems or network of PB Web Media or third parties, for example as a result of a (d)dos attack or security breach, PB Web Media is entitled to take all measures necessary to avert this damage or danger. This may result in temporary unavailability of the Website.</li>
                </ol>

                <h2>ARTICLE 9. INTELLECTUAL PROPERTY</h2>
                <ol>

                    <li>Information you store or process using the service is and remains your property (or the property of your suppliers or licensors). PB Web Media receives a limited license to use this information for the service.</li>
                    <li>You can terminate the license of the previous clause by removing the information in question and/or by terminating the ToS.</li>
                    <li>You may change or remove information you publish or store using the service at your own discretion.</li>
                    <li>If you send information to PB Web Media, for example a bug report or suggestion for improvement, you grant PB Web Media a perpetual and unlimited license to use this information for the service. This does not apply to information you expressly mark as confidential.</li>
                </ol>

                <h2>ARTICLE 10. DATA PROTECTION AND PRIVACY</h2>
                <ol>
                    <li>PB Web Media will make every effort to secure the Website against misuse and unauthorized access.</li>
                    <li>When using the Website, personal data of you will be processed. You should consult the Privacy Statement for more information in this regard.</li>
                    <li>PB Web Media shall refrain from accessing personal data you store or transfer using the Website, unless this is necessary for a good provision of the service or PB Web Media is forced to do so by law or order of competent authority. In these cases, PB Web Media shall use its best efforts to limit access to the information as much as possible.</li>
                </ol>

                <h2>ARTICLE 11. LIMITATION OF LIABILITY</h2>

                    <li>In case of force majeure PB Web Media is never required to compensate damages suffered by you. Force majeure includes among others, disruptions or unavailability of the internet, telecommunication infrastructure, power interruptions, riots, traffic jams, strikes, pandemic, company disruptions, interruptions in supply, fires and floods.</li>
                </ol>

                <h2>ARTICLE 12. TERM AND TERMINATION</h2>
                <ol>
                    <li>This ToS enters into force as soon as you first use the Service and then remains in force until terminated.</li>
                </ol>

                <h2>ARTICLE 13. CHANGES TO THE TERMS OF SERVICE</h2>
